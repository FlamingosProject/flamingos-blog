# Introducing Flamingos

This blog book describes the Flamingos Project. Flamingos is
a tutorial operating system written in Rust and intended for
deployment on inexpensive and commonly-available hardware.

You can find the Flamingos Project blog book at the
[Flamingos website] or on the [Flamingos blog Github]. There is
a [Flamingos RSS feed] for the project. You will likely also
want to look at the [Flamingos Github] itself.

The idea of the Flamingos Project is to provide a way to
learn about OS kernel construction using Rust and
inexpensive hardware. The Flamingos kernel runs on the US$15
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a four-core 64-bit ARM processor with
an MMU. It also runs on the Raspberry Pi 3B and the
Raspberry Pi 4.

## Blog Book

A "blog book" is what it says on the tin: an [mdbook] book
that is intended to also be readable as an ongoing
blog.

This blog book follows the progress of an evolving piece of
software, the Flamingos OS kernel. In the foreseeable
future, Flamingos may also acquire a userspace: there's a
lot to do first.
